Since I use Virtualbox in Ubuntu I suffered of several kernel errors each time I updated my Ubuntu distribution.
This tutorial is a quick step way of solving this issue:

1. Try this:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup

2. You'll probably get the following message:
WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
         Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate
         headers, most likely linux-headers-generic.

         You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.

3. For previous versions of Ubuntu try:
$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-dkms

If you're using Ubuntu 13.04 then the package will be virtualbox-dkms, so:
$ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms

4. Then we can see if the vbox module is added:
$ dkms status (this will show your current version to be used in the following command)

5. Then install it:
$ sudo dkms install virtualbox/<version>

If you dont have the kernel headers you will get this error (the linux-headers version will be probably different):
Error! Your kernel headers for kernel 3.2.0-26-generic cannot be found.
Please install the linux-headers-3.2.0-26-generic package,
or use the --kernelsourcedir option to tell DKMS where it's located

6. So we install them:
$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-<newest-version>-generic

7. And finally we have to 'start' the modules:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/virtualbox start


Now, if you try to run $ virtualbox in your terminal and no installation is found, then install it by:
$ sudo aptitude install virtualbox-qt

Then run it and you should be able to manage your virtual machines again :)
